DESCRIPTION = """
Termenu is a command line utility and Python library for displaying console
based interactive menus.

Traditionally there are two types of applications running the Unix shell: pure
command line utilities such as grep, sed and awk and full screen interactive
applications such as Midnight Commander. Termenu aims to bridge this gap and
allow a modicum of interactivity in regular command line utilities.
